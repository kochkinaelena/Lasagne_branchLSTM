This file contains **predictions made by the branch-LSTM** model trained on full RumourEval-2017 dataset (including the testing set) and applied to rumours in the [PHEME](https://figshare.com/articles/PHEME_dataset_for_Rumour_Detection_and_Veracity_Classification/6392078) dataset (including the overlap) 


Please note that these are automated predictions, **not** gold_standard human annotated labels. The accuracy of predictions on the PHEME dataset was not evaluated due to the absence of human annotated labels for comparison.
